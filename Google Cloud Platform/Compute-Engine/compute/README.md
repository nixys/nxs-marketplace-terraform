## Settings

| Option | Type | Required | Default value |Description |
| --- | ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| `disks.description` | String | No | "Created by Terraform" | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| `disks.zone` | String | No | "us-central1-a" | A reference to the zone where the disk resides. |
| `disks.size` | Int | No | null | Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when creating a persistent disk using the image or snapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk. If you specify this field along with image or snapshot, the value must not be less than the size of the image or the size of the snapshot. ~>NOTE If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested. You can add lifecycle.prevent_destroy in the config to prevent destroying and recreating. |
| `disks.physical_block_size_bytes` | Int | No | null | Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present in a request, a default value is used. Currently supported sizes are 4096 and 16384, other sizes may be added in the future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list the supported values for the caller's project. |
| `disks.source_disk` | String | No | null | The source disk used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. |
| `disks.type` | String | No | null | URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk. |
| `disks.image` | String | No | null | The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be one of: the image's self_link, projects/{project}/global/images/{image}, projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}, global/images/{image}, global/images/family/{family}, family/{family}, {project}/{family}, {project}/{image}, {family}, or {image}. If referred by family, the images names must include the family name. If they don't, use the google_compute_image data source. For instance, the image centos-6-v20180104 includes its family name centos-6. These images can be referred by family name here. |

Note: Updating currently is only supported by hyperdisk skus without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk allows for an update of IOPS every 4 hours. To update your hyperdisk more frequently, you'll need to manually delete and recreate it. |
| `disks.provisioned_throughput` | Int | No | null | Indicates how much Throughput must be provisioned for the disk. Note: Updating currently is only supported by hyperdisk skus without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk allows for an update of Throughput every 4 hours.

| `instances.advanced_machine_features.enable_nested_virtualization` | Bool | No | null | Defines whether the instance should have nested virtualization enabled. Defaults to false. |
| `instances.advanced_machine_features.threads_per_core` | Int | No | null | he number of threads per physical core. To disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. |
| `instances.advanced_machine_features.visible_core_count` | Int | No | null | The number of physical cores to expose to an instance. visible cores info (VC). |
| `instances.reservation_affinity` | List | No | [] | Specifies the reservations that this instance can consume from. |
| `instances.reservation_affinity.type` | String | Yes | - | The type of reservation from which this instance can consume resources. |
| `instances.reservation_affinity.specific_reservation` | List | No | [] | Specifies the label selector for the reservation to use. |
| `instances.reservation_affinity.specific_reservation.key` | String | Yes | - | Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource. To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, specify compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name as the key and specify the name of your reservation as the only value. |
| `instances.reservation_affinity.specific_reservation.values` | String | Yes | - | Corresponds to the label values of a reservation resource. |
| `instances.network_performance_config` | List | No | [] | onfigures network performance settings for the instance.  |
| `instances.network_performance_config.total_egress_bandwidth_tier` | String | Yes | - | The egress bandwidth tier to enable. Possible values: TIER_1, DEFAULT |
| `instances.enable_display` | Bool | No | null | Enable Virtual Displays on this instance. Note: allow_stopping_for_update must be set to true or your instance must have a desired_status of TERMINATED in order to update this field. |
| `instances.resource_policies` | List | No | null | A list of self_links of resource policies to attach to the instance. Modifying this list will cause the instance to recreate. Currently a max of 1 resource policy is supported. |
| `instances.tags` | List | No | [] | A list of network tags to attach to the instance. |
| `instances.labels` | Map | No | {} | A set of key/value label pairs assigned to the disk. This field is only applicable for persistent disks. |

| `instance_groups.zone` | String | Yes | - | The zone that this instance group should be created in. |
| `instance_groups.description` | String | No | "Created by Terraform" | An optional textual description of the instance group. |
| `instance_groups.instance_name` | List | No | [] | The list of instances in the group, in self_link format. When adding instances they must all be in the same network and zone as the instance group. |
| `instance_groups.network` | String | No | null | The URL of the network the instance group is in. If this is different from the network where the instances are in, the creation fails. Defaults to the network where the instances are in (if neither network nor instances is specified, this field will be blank). |
| `instance_groups.project` | String | No | null | The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided, the provider project is used. |
